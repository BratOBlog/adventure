Sword and sorcery adventure generator for fun

Main efforts are to generate random answers to the parts, so a somewhat campaing descripton or writing prompt can be established.
The generator is based on Ben Ball's generator on https://www.hyperborea.tv/uploads/4/4/6/6/44662451/asshrandom-adv-gen.pdf.

The code behind it is a simple quote generator based on FreeCodeCamp random quote generator: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/creating-a-bare-bones-quote-generator-with-javascript-and-html-for-absolute-beginners-5264e1725f08/

THe CSS is just random experimenting with different styles.

So all credit goes to the original sources, hope you enjoy playing aroung with this generator as much as I enjoyed making it.
